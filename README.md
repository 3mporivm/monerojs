# Monero Library
A Monero library written in Node.js by the [Monero Integrations](https://monerointegrations.com) [team](https://github.com/monero-integrations/moneronodejs/graphs/contributors).

[//]: # (**NOTE:** due to the existence of the `monero-nodejs` package by PsychicCat at https://github.com/PsychicCat/monero-nodejs , `moneronodejs` will never be publishable on npm.  Thus, this repository is being finalized, archived, and continued as `monerojs` at https://github/com/sneurlax/monerojs.  If the Monero Integrations team will merge this into monero-ingtegrations/moneronodejs https://github.com/monero-integrations/moneronodejs then it will be revived and updated as needed, otherwise please refer to `monerojs` https://github/com/sneurlax/monerojs for the latest code and best features.)
